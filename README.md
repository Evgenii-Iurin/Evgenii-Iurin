## Data Analysis Project: Stretching Studio

**Project Goal:** Analyze user behavior and financial data to improve retention and pricing strategy for a stretching studio.

> **Note:** The project was conducted under NDA due to the use of sensitive financial data. While specific results and datasets are confidential, I can share my overall analytical approach and methodology.

### Key Contributions:
- **Data Cleaning:** Processed and structured raw user and transaction data for further analysis.
- **Churn Prediction:** Developed a model to identify users unlikely to renew their subscription, using behavioral and transactional features.
- **Financial Analysis & Pricing:** Conducted exploratory financial analysis and provided recommendations on pricing optimization based on customer value segmentation.

**Approach Overview:**
- Defined KPIs and target labels (e.g., churned users)
- Performed feature engineering based on user activity and payment patterns
- Evaluated model performance and interpreted results
- Presented insights and pricing suggestions to stakeholders

**Tech stack:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), SQL, Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib/seaborn


## Statistics

Worked on real-world cases using datasets from an online streaming platform focused on series and films (KION). Due to an NDA, project notebooks cannot be shared publicly, but selected parts can be demonstrated during a call (permission granted).
