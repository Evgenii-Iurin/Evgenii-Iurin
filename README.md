## 👋🏻 Hi there, I’m Evgenii. 
I’m a student at the Warsaw University of Technology. I’m very big on computer vision and machine learning. I stick to philosophy in my life: if you want to know something good, explain it to others. Therefore, I make videos about geometry, ML, CV, and physics and share them on my Instagram profile. Also, you can read my popular scientific articles on Medium. I recommend reading the article "Projective Geometry" with my own illustrations. At university, I give a lecture to a student. I believe in the automation of our world for the benefit of mankind and want to be a part of this future.
